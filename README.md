# todolist with bootstrap and javascript

This is a project forked from https://github.com/zentech/todolist/blob/master/js/index.js
Thanks for zentech for his work.

Some modifications were made to the original project to enable more functions.

Now the todoList supports remove certain todos from list or remove all todos.
